REVISION NOTE: This model supersedes the previous 2267e hypothesis. Following a review of the primary research on TOI-2267 A (M5) and TOI-2267 B (M6), the target planet is now identified as 2267d (EBONIS).

Scientific Adjustment: > * Host Star: M6 Red Dwarf.

Stability: Planet is maintained within the one million five hundred eighty thousand mile Hill Sphere of the M6 star.

Illumination: Receives secondary radiative flux from the M5 star across a seven hundred forty-four million mile void, creating the Eternal Dusk condition.
Exhibit A: The TOI-2267 Steering Wheel Correction
Title: Gravitational Stability and Biological Convergence in a Widely Separated M-Dwarf Binary.

I. The 3-1-1 Mass Architecture
The stability of this system is governed by a specific mass distribution:

The M5 Anchor: A Three-Earth-mass planet acting as a gravitational ballast.

The M5 Neighbor: One Earth-sized planet in a local resonant orbit.

The M6 Sentinel (EBONIS): One Earth-sized planet situated two million miles from the M6 star.

II. The Binary Bridge Interaction
The seven hundred forty-four million mile separation between Star A (M5) and Star B (M6) is not a void, but a thermal and gravitational bridge.

Thermal Floor: Star A provides constant infrared flux to the dark side of EBONIS, ensuring the planet never drops below the freezing point of water.

Atmospheric Engine: This dual-heat source creates global convection, preventing the "Tidal Lock Death" common in single Red Dwarf systems.

III. Biological Convergence (The EBONIS Human)
Because EBONIS possesses Earth-like gravity, liquid water, and identical chemical elements, biological evolution has converged on the human form.

Physicality: The humans are identical in height and skeletal structure to Earth humans due to the one-to-one gravity ratio.

Adaptations: They possess Deep Metallic Integument (skin) to manage infrared radiation and Multispectral Vision to navigate the Eternal Dusk created by the two suns.

Conclusion: The system is not only stable but is "Super-Habitable," providing a more consistent energy environment than Earth.
