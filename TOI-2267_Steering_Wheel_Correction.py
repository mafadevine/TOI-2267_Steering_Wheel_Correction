TOI-2267: The Steering Wheel Correction
Technical Abstract
Title: Stability of Multi-Body Planetary Chains in Widely Separated M-Dwarf Binaries: The TOI-2267 Correction.

Summary: This research repository provides a gravitational and radiative model for the TOI-2267 system. We demonstrate that the system maintains stability through a Binary Bridge configuration. By situating the three Earth-sized planets within the distinct Hill Spheres of the M5 and M6 stars—separated by seven hundred forty-four million miles—we eliminate the gravitational chaos found in traditional tight-binary models.

Our findings conclude that the planet EBONIS (designated 2267d/e) exists in a state of Eternal Dusk. The planet receives constant, multi-spectral illumination from both stars, creating a stable, non-freezing environment. Through atmospheric convection, the planet avoids the formation of total deserts or ice caps, making it a viable candidate for complex biological life.

Core System Specifications
1. The Stellar Binary Engine
Primary Star (A): M5 Red Dwarf.

Secondary Star (B): M6 Red Dwarf.

Separation Distance: Seven hundred forty-four million miles.

Interaction Type: Gravitational and Magnetic Interaction Bridge.

2. The Planetary Architecture (The 5-1-1 Ratio)
The M5 Cluster: Hosts the Five-Earth-mass anchor and two Earth-sized planets within a two million five hundred eighty thousand mile stability radius.

The M6 Sentinel (EBONIS): A single Earth-sized world orbiting the M6 star within a one million five hundred eighty thousand mile stability radius.

3. The Atmospheric and Light Model
Primary Light: Soft pink illumination from the M6 star.

Secondary Light: Constant red infrared glow from the M5 star.

Thermodynamics: A global "Never-Freeze" condition facilitated by the seven hundred forty-four million mile infrared bridge.
